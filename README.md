# underwater-image-synthesis-algorithm
It is an underwater image synthesis algorithm based on underwater image formulation model.

You need to prepare the images that need to be converted into an underwater style and the corresponding depth maps.

In addition, we give some values of underwater parameters for different underwater types based on 'Underwater scene prior inspired deep underwater image and video enhancement'.
The underwater type is named from 1 to 10, while the larger the value, the more seriously the image is affected.
Certainly, you can set the underwater parameters by yourself. 

Here are some examplesï¼š
